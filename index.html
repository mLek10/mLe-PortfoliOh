        <h3>About Me</h3>
            Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Emily Caton (she,her), or as I like to put it mLe-k10. (guess I've been using shorthand my whole life without even realizing).
        I am an introverted 33yr old stay-at-home mom of two wonderful kiddos, ages 7 and 4.  As my children phase into their world of going to school and getting an education, I thought
        it would be a great time for me to further my education and build a new useful skill for me to use out in the real world. As you are reading this, I am currently in a 
        computer coding bootcamp for full-stack web development. I have always been fascinated by the ins and outs of computers and the world wide web but never took the time
        to educate myself, all this to say this is a very new and exciting learning process for me. Outside of being a mom and attending school, I find lots of peace and comfort
        out in nature. Gardening has become a great passion of mine in the past few years as I discovered I inherited my mother's green thumb! Finding time to be expressive
        and creative, in any way, has always been very important to me and my wellness. I believe my urge to be creative is a great strength to have in the web-development community. Problem 
        solving and using my imagination lights a fire inside me. I cannot wait to put my skills to use and challenge myself in a fulfilling career.
