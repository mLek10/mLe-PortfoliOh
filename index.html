        <h3>About Me</h3>
            Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Emily Caton, or as I like to put it, mLe-k10. I am a 33yr old stay-at-home mom of two
        wonderful kiddos, ages 7 and 4.  As my children phase into their world of going to school and getting an education, I thought it would be a 
        great time for me to further my education and build a new useful skill for me to use out in the real world. As you are reading this, I am currently 
        in a computer coding bootcamp for full-stack web development. I have always been fascinated by the ins and outs of computers and the worldwide web 
        but never took the time to educate myself on the topic. All this to say, this is a very new and exciting learning process for me. Outside of being a 
        mom and attending school, I find lots of peace and comfort out in nature. Gardening has become a great passion of mine in the past few years. Finding 
        time to be expressive and creative, in any way, has always been very important to me and my wellness. I believe my urge to be creative and solve problems 
        is a great strength to have in the web-development community. I cannot wait to put my skills to use and challenge myself in a fulfilling web-development career.
